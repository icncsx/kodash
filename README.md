# Kodash

This is a Lodash clone I built to learn how to create a utility library such as Lodash and Underscore.

## Installation

Using npm:

```
npm install @icncsx/kodash
```

In Node.js:

```js
import _ from "@icncsx/kodash"
_.head([1,2,3,4]) // 1
```

## API

Functions mimic those which exist in [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/).

Want to flatten an array? We got that. Want to remove an array of matching elements from an array. We also have that (✌️). 

## Production

No no no! Use Lodash or Underscore if you want a battle tested utility library. This library is purposely derivative and redundant because I'm using it mainly for learning purposes.
